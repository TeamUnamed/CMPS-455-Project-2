## Getting Started
Remember, do not commit directly to the [main branch](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2), use the [dev branch](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2/tree/dev) for all active work.
### Create a new issue
When you are ready to work on a specific feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2/issues/new/choose) or pick one that is not already assigned. Make sure you:
1. Set the label as ***feature***
2. If it is required, set the milestone as ***Project Completion***.
3. \[Optional\] Create a new branch for the issue. (Working off of the [dev branch](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2/tree/dev), while not preferred, is acceptable.
### Work on the feature
1. Clone the branch you intend to work on to your local repository.
2. Work on the feature.
3. Commit the changes to the appropriate branch and push. *Note: Try to only commit related changes.*
### Pull Request - \[Optional\]
You only have to do this if you followed #3 when creating a new issue.
1. Create a pull request from the feature's branch to the [dev branch](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2/tree/dev).
2. Be sure to select the option to close the issue when creating the pull request, otherwise you will need to close it manually.
### Project Complete
Once we are ready to finalize the project we will create a pull request from the [dev branch](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2/tree/dev) to the [main branch](https://github.com/jmaab/CMPS-455-Project-2). *Note: It requires approval from one other team member to accept a pull request directed to ***main***.
